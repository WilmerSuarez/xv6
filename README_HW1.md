# Project Title

One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

    How does the xv6 kernel determine which system call was requested?

    How is control dispatched to the kernel code that implements the requested system call?

    How does the xv6 kernel obtain the arguments to the system call?

    How are system call results returned to the user process?
    
 For this assignment, as well as for all later assignments, you are to create a "readme file" and commit it to your git repository. This file, should be called README_HW1, README_HW2, etc. and it should be placed in the top-level xv6 directory. It should be a text file designed to be read by a human being, and it should contain the following kinds of items:

    An overview of what you did for that assignment, designed to guide us in looking at your code and evaluating its output.

    A description of how to compile your code and demonstrate its operation, including how to run any test cases.

    A summary of any assumptions or design decisions you made in implementing your code.

    Any "explanation" or "analysis" you are specifically asked to include with your assignment.

Some portion of your grade will be associated with whether you have included an appropriate, readable writeup file with your submission. 

You should consider it your responsibility to demonstrate that your system works properly.  To the extent that your test programs serve this purpose, it would be useful to include them with your submission, together with some text in the README file that explains how to run them and what aspects of your program operation they demonstrate.
