# Introduction to xv6

Added two systemcalls:

'''
getdate: 
setdate: 
'''

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system


    How does the xv6 kernel determine which system call was requested?

    How is control dispatched to the kernel code that implements the requested system call?

    How does the xv6 kernel obtain the arguments to the system call?

    How are system call results returned to the user process?
    
    An overview of what you did for that assignment, designed to guide us in looking at your code and evaluating its output.

    A description of how to compile your code and demonstrate its operation, including how to run any test cases.

    A summary of any assumptions or design decisions you made in implementing your code.

    Any "explanation" or "analysis" you are specifically asked to include with your assignment.

You should consider it your responsibility to demonstrate that your system works properly.  To the extent that your test programs serve this purpose, it would be useful to include them with your submission, together with some text in the README file that explains how to run them and what aspects of your program operation they demonstrate.
